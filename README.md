SurfaceViewer. 28/11/20.

An application for building and viewing 3D graphs - surfaces, specified in parametric form, with support for animation and different display methods.
There is no GUI yet, so the interaction of the application with the user is carried out through the text file "graph_config", which must be located in the same folder with the application. The file specifies the ways of displaying and defining the functions of parametric setting of the graph.
